Lecturer feedback:

You were expected to screenshot and describe your GUI rather than just submitting your code. 
This is to prepare you for work where you are expected to be able to create Mock UI's without functionality. Currently, your app is unable to approve verify claims. See side image for what was expected. Your design is quite basic and has not diverged much from the default style. See if you can add more life to the application by making use of a different colour scheme and maybe using some icons to help with readability. I do like that approval bar you have

How was it addressed:
More functionality
